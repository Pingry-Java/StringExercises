String Exercises
================

This class has three methods that operate on strings in interesting (but difficult) ways.

This project is from the College Board, so it covers material directly relevant to the AP test. Please implement the methods using only java that is in the AP subset (easily googleable and also posted on our moodle page).

Write the methods, and update the following sections of the readme with relevant documentation.

findString
----------

countStrings
------------

convertItalics
--------------

Usage
-----
This program does not have a main method and therefore cannot be run as a standalone program.
It can be compiled with: `javac StringExercises.java`
